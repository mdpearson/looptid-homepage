I started Looptid Microsystems in 2024 after 25+ years as a software engineer,
most recently in clinical genomics and global health IT. I wanted the
flexibility to be the primary parent in my household while my spouse furthers
her own medical career, and I wanted to focus exclusively on mission-driven
projects where the work actually matters.

Midway through my career, I completed a chaplaincy residency at
[MGH](https://www.massgeneral.org/spiritual-care/education), where I served
the burn and neurology units. That experience profoundly shaped my sense of
vocation, and I'm still working that out. I’m drawn to projects where
infrastructure decisions affect real people’s lives, whether that’s cancer
diagnoses, medical supply chains, or anything that harnesses technology in
service of a humane purpose. Hiring managers often ask about this background,
and I’m glad they do. It’s a key reason why I gravitate toward consequential
systems work rather than just chasing the highest-paying contract.

I’m based in Bellingham, Washington and have worked remotely for a decade. I’m
comfortable collaborating across time zones, working asynchronously when needed,
and building relationships with teams I rarely see in person.

I believe infrastructure work should disappear when it’s done right. Systems
should be reliable enough so people can stop worrying about them and focus on
their actual work. I’d rather spend time preventing problems than firefighting
them, and I’d rather improve existing systems than build shiny new ones from
scratch. I’m more of a mechanic than an architect.

If that approach sounds like what your organization needs, I’d be glad to talk.
