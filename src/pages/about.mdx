I started Looptid Microsystems in 2024 after 25+ years as a software engineer,
most recently in clinical diagnostics and global health IT. I wanted the
flexibility to be the primary parent in my household while my spouse furthers
her medical practice, and I wanted to focus exclusively on mission-driven
projects where the work actually matters.

Midway through my career, I served the burn and neurology units at
[MGH](https://www.massgeneral.org/spiritual-care/education) as a chaplain
resident. That experience profoundly shaped my sense of vocation, and I'm still
working that out. I’m drawn to projects where infrastructure decisions positively
affect people’s lives, like cancer diagnoses, medical supply chains,
or really anything that harnesses technology in service of a humane purpose.
Hiring managers occasionally ask about my experience as a chaplain, and I’m glad
when they do. It’s a key reason why I gravitate toward consequential
systems work rather than just chasing the highest-paying contract.

I’m based in [Bellingham, Washington](https://cob.org/visiting/about-visiting)
and have worked remotely for a decade. I’m comfortable collaborating across time
zones, working asynchronously when needed, and building relationships with teams
I rarely see in person.

I take infrastructure work seriously so that other people can take it for
granted. Systems should be reliable enough so people can stop worrying about
them and focus on their actual work. I’d rather spend time anticipating and
preventing problems than firefighting them, and I’d rather improve existing
systems than build shiny new ones from scratch. I’m more of a mechanic than an
architect.

If my approach sounds like what your organization needs,
