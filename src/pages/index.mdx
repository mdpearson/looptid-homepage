I'm Matthew Pearson, and I help mission-driven organizations modernize
infrastructure without disrupting or breaking their production work.

I've fully halved operational costs through right-sizing and server
consolidation, built a service to migrate 6+ PiB of genomics data to cloud
storage while keeping hot data on-prem, and maintained gene- and
variant-calling pipelines processing millions of samples. I've added
observability to a variety of projects ranging from legacy monoliths to
Kubernetes microservices, helping teams see problems before users do.

I typically work with genomics and international development clients on
engagements of 3+ months. I'm happy to work on retainer and currently have
capacity for an additional project or two.
