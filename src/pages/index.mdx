title: 'Looptid Microsystems'

I'm Matthew Pearson, and I help mission-driven organizations modernize
infrastructure without breaking production systems.

I've cut operational costs 50% through right-sizing and server consolidation,
migrated 6+ PiB of genomics data to cloud storage, and maintained gene- and
variant-calling pipelines processing millions of samples. I've added
observability to a variety of projects ranging from legacy monoliths to
Kubernetes microservices, helping teams see problems before users do.

I typically work with genomics and international development clients on
engagements of 3+ months. I'm happy to work on retainer and currently have
capacity for an additional project or two.
